## Introduction

Exploratory Data Analysis Peer Assessment 2. 

Empty repository at https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_PeerAssessment2  
I have created a new one for myself.

Assignment at https://class.coursera.org/exdata-002/human_grading/view/courses/972082/assessments/4/submissions  
I would prefer to use the Markdown (?) file there as a starting point, but I do not see the source code.
