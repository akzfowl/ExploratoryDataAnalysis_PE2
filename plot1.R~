# Question 1:
# Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to
# 2008? Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5
# emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

# Read the data file might take some time since it is quite large
